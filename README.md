## LLM as Human

### LLM for Political Science
- Hypothesis generation
- Silico simulation
- Agent-based treatment

### Political Science for LLM
- **Alignment**: Addressing cultural biases and aligning large language models with human values.
  Cultural bias and cultural alignment of large language models[Paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae346).
- Benchmarking: Establishing standards to evaluate the performance of LLMs in political contexts.

## LLM as Tool

### LLM for Political Science
- Annotation: Utilizing LLMs to assist in data annotation processes.
- Codebook development: Creating frameworks for organizing qualitative data.

### Political Science for LLM
- Retrieving: Enhancing retrieval methods using insights from political science to improve model responses.

This structured overview emphasizes the multifaceted interactions between Large Language Models and the field of political science, highlighting both the applications of LLMs in research and the contributions of political science to the development and alignment of these models.
